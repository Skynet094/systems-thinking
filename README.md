# Systems thinking

Some notes on the different types of systems thinking.

“In systems thinking, increases in understanding are believed to be obtainable
by expanding the systems to be understood, not by reducing them to their
elements.” Russell L. Ackoff (quoted by [Steven
Shorrock](https://humanisticsystems.com/2019/11/25/four-kinds-of-thinking-2-systems-thinking/)
